## Aim 
Create a game suitable for children aged 10 and 14 years. The game can be 2D or 3D and must be developed using Unity. Need to learn
to use Git, plan your project, and develop it based on use cases and tests. Total work of 50 hours work each over the period, which
should result with a simple playable game at a minimum. 

## Our Game - AstroEscape 
Game Mechanics <br> 
Game Story <br> 
How to play <br> 

## Planning Documents 
Initial Ideas <br>
Stakeholder Description <br>
User Stories <br>
MVP Plan <br>

## Progress monitoring

### <u>Sprints </u>

Our team works on a weekly sprint basis where once a week on Tuesdays 12:00-14:00 we meet up in person for a Sprint Meeting that covers:
- Sprint Review: Covering all the work each team memeber has done since last sprint meeting including any outstanding/ blocked tasks that need to be adjusted for next sprint
- Sprint Retrospective: List down what went well and what could be improved for the coming sprint
- Sprint Planning: Plan the tasks to complete for next sprints, including the Task | Story Points | Who is doing the task

For sprint planning we use <b>points poker</b> for the team to agree on the estimated amount of time to complete each task. This points poker is done online and the votes are hidden until the end. If there is mixed votes then we discuss as a team why each person voted for different estimated amount of time. 1 Point = 1 Day of work

### <u>Jira</u>

For the team project tasks organisation we use Jira. Jira is an exceptional sprint management tool that is heavily used in Industry for software engineering. Plus a few of the team memebers were already experienced in using this tool including our Scrum Master Ernestas who has used Jira to scrum lead industry teams. <br>

Jira provides the tools to create detailed tasks and assign them between backlog and current sprint.

Once tasks are moved from backlog to sprint list and sprint has been started; then the <b>Kanban Board</b> is updated to the active sprint. This makes it easier to track each persons tasks and what they are currently developing

Jira also provides the useful tool to create automated reports including <b>sprint burndown charts </b> from the report section.

Here are examples of some useful charts to evaluate the teams progress of Burnup Report (similar to burndown chart, however upwards to completetion) and Cumulative Flow Diagram

### <u>GitHub</u>

While we monitor the teams progress mostly via Sprint Reviews, Jira burn downs and Meeting Minutes. The work itself is then tracked via GitHub. This is where we store the summary of our teams written, design and coded work; including the game project AstroEscape. You can currently see our GitHub from this main page that the README.md is on and explore the files and completed that match our Jira plan. A useful tool of GitHub is also monitoring the team's progress via git commits
