## Scheduling 
To ensure effective collaboration and project progress, our team implemented a structured scheduling system for sprint meetings and development tasks. We began by tracking team members' availability and determined that Tuesdays would be the best day for sprint meetings.

[AvailableTimings](Documents/Team%20Info/AvailibleTimings.pdf)

We meticulously documented all meetings, tracking key details such as attendance, discussion points, progress updates, and agreed actions. This information was recorded in a structured meeting log, allowing us to monitor our development milestones effectively. Sprint meetings focused on task distribution, retrospectives, prototype development, and refining game mechanics.

[MeetingMinutes](Documents/Team%20Info/MeetingMinutes.pdf)

Communication tools like Teams and WhatsApp helped us stay connected between meetings. By maintaining detailed records and utilizing these tools, we ensured that our team remained aligned and productive throughout the project.

## Progress monitoring

### <u>Sprints </u>

Our team works on a weekly sprint basis where once a week on Tuesdays 12:00-14:00 we meet up in person for a Sprint Meeting that covers:
- Sprint Review: Covering all the work each team memeber has done since last sprint meeting including any outstanding/ blocked tasks that need to be adjusted for next sprint
- Sprint Retrospective: List down what went well and what could be improved for the coming sprint
- Sprint Planning: Plan the tasks to complete for next sprints, including the Task | Story Points | Who is doing the task

For sprint planning we use <b>points poker</b> for the team to agree on the estimated amount of time to complete each task. This points poker is done online and the votes are hidden until the end. If there is mixed votes then we discuss as a team why each person voted for different estimated amount of time. 1 Point = 1 Day of work

### <u>Jira</u>

For the team project tasks organisation we use Jira. Jira is an exceptional sprint management tool that is heavily used in Industry for software engineering. Plus a few of the team memebers were already experienced in using this tool including our Scrum Master Ernestas who has used Jira to scrum lead industry teams. <br>

Jira provides the tools to create detailed tasks and assign them between backlog and current sprint.

Once tasks are moved from backlog to sprint list and sprint has been started; then the <b>Kanban Board</b> is updated to the active sprint. This makes it easier to track each persons tasks and what they are currently developing

<img src="Resources/ReadMe%20Images/JiraKanban.png" width=600 height=300>

Jira also provides the useful tool to create automated reports including <b>sprint burndown charts </b> from the report section.

### <u>GitHub</u>

While we monitor the teams progress mostly via Sprint Reviews, Jira burn downs and Meeting Minutes. The work itself is then tracked via GitHub. This is where we store the summary of our teams written, design and coded work; including the game project AstroEscape. You can currently see our GitHub from this main page that the README.md is on and explore the files and completed that match our Jira plan. A useful tool of GitHub is also monitoring the team's progress via git commits

Manual playtesting was conducted to validate:  
- **Menu Navigation**: Ensured buttons work correctly and screens transition smoothly.  
- **Level Selection**: Verified levels load correctly and statistics display properly.  
- **Player Mechanics**: Confirmed movement works as expected in all directions.  
- **Maze & Question System**: Ensured question prompts behave correctly and answers are validated properly.  
- **Collectibles System**: Checked that picking up collectibles updates the score and unlocks achievements.  
### Automated Unit Testing
Unit tests were implemented to verify core game mechanics, including:  
#### Door Unlock System
- The door unlocks when the correct answer is provided.  
- The door remains locked with an incorrect answer.  
#### Collectibles System
- Players start with zero collectibles.  
- Picking up a collectible increases the collectible count.  
### Beta Testing & Feedback
To further refine the game, we will be conducting a **beta testing phase**, where players can provide feedback through a **survey**. This will help us identify any remaining bugs, improve gameplay mechanics, and enhance overall user experience.

## Pair and Mob Programming
### Pair Programming
Our team embraced pair programming to enhance collaboration and foster continuous learning. We leveraged VS Code Live Share to connect remotely and work on the same codebase in real-time. This tool enabled us to share our screens, work on code together, and resolve any issues. To complement the coding sessions, we set up Microsoft Teams calls where we could discuss our strategies, provide instant feedback, and brainstorm solutions. During these sessions, team members alternated between the actively writing code and reviewing and guiding the coding process. This rotation not only improved our code quality by catching potential issues early but also helped spread knowledge and skills across the team.

### Mob Programming
To further enhance team collaboration and collective problem-solving, we also incorporated mob programming into our workflow. We dedicated specific time slots during our weekly sprint meetings for these sessions. During mob programming, the entire team focused on solving a particular challenge or developing a new feature together. One team member would take control of the keyboard, while everyone else contributed ideas, reviewed the code, and discussed various approaches. This inclusive environment ensured that the final solution benefitted from diverse perspectives and collective expertise. It also allowed us to address complex problems more effectively and helped maintain high coding standards, as the group continuously evaluated and refined the code.

### Benefits and Outcomes
The combination of pair and mob programming had several positive outcomes for our project:
-	Enhanced Collaboration: Both approaches fostered a strong sense of teamwork and ensured that everyone was actively involved in the development process.
-	Improved Code Quality: Real-time peer review helped catch errors early, reducing the risk of bugs and promoting better coding practices.
-	Knowledge Sharing: By rotating roles and collaborating closely, team members learned from each other building a more resilient team.
-	Efficient Problem-Solving: Collective brainstorming during mob programming sessions often led to innovative solutions and quicker resolution of issues.
Overall, integrating these collaborative programming techniques not only strengthened our development process but also contributed to a more cohesive and agile team, ultimately leading to higher quality project outcomes.


## Development process 


## Final Retrospective 
In conclusion, the team demonstrated strong collaboration over the duration of this project. Due to weekly sprint standups and detailed documentation, the overall organisation ensured a smooth and efficient workflow.

#### Project Planning and Management

At the start of the project, identifying each team member’s strengths and weaknesses allowed us to utilise the skill set of team members in the most effective way and addressed potential upcoming challenges where there were gaps in knowledge. Assigning roles based on these strengths also helped enable better organisation of tasks. <br>
To manage our workflow, the use of an agile approach using Jira task tracking and GitHub for version control. We held weekly meetings to discuss progress, challenges and any adjustments we felt were necessary. Despite initial challenges with Git due to some team members not having previous experience, the team gradually became proficient. The knowledge sharing between team members enabled those who were less proficient to pick up and learn new skills. The exchange of skills within the team was beneficial is ensuring everyone contributed to all aspects. <br>
Detailed retrospectives of each sprint enabled to maintain organisation and keep track of the backlog of tasks and upcoming tasks for the next sprint. This came in handy to ensure each team member was aware of what was expected of them each week and gave the opportunity to reflect and improve on things that might not have gone well from the previous sprint. <br>

#### Challenges and Resolutions

- Version control issues: Initially some members were unfamiliar with GitHub. We overcame this by creating a Git guide and providing Git tutorials.
- Time management: Completing the project within the given time was addressed this by prioritising certain features within our requirements and creating a timeline. Each week we assigned tasks for the upcoming sprints and set realistic goals.
- Technical limitations: Some members had limited Unity experience. We overcame this by sharing online resources and pair programming as well as live tutorials.
  
#### Key Takeaways
This project helped us learn a lot about successful software engineering management. While some team members had previous experience in agile methodology and working together to roll out software, for some members this was their first experience. Some key learnings were: <br>
- Effective collaboration: Clear role assignments and structured weekly meetings significantly improved our workflow.
- Git for collaboration: Mastering Git was a valuable learning curve that enhanced our teamwork and allowed for efficient collaboration.
- Testing and Iteration: Frequent testing enabled us to refine the game mechanics and usability.

#### Conclusion 

Overall, this project was an excellent learning experience in software engineering management. We successfully met the educational goals for the target audience. More importantly, we developed collaboration, planning and technical skills that will benefit us in future projects. Our team worked effectively, and the experience has given us insight into the real world, preparing us for industry practice.
