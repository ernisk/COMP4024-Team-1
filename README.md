## Aim 
Create a game suitable for children aged 10 and 14 years. The game can be 2D or 3D and must be developed using Unity. Need to learn
to use Git, plan your project, and develop it based on use cases and tests. Total work of 50 hours work each over the period, which
should result with a simple playable game at a minimum.

## Planning Documents 
Initial Ideas <br>

AstroEscape is set in a mysterious alien space station where players take on the role of an astronaut navigating through complex mazes to escape. The core design ideas are as follows:

1. Gameplay
•	Players control their character using keyboard arrow keys or touch gestures to move through the maze./
•	Players must solve puzzles or collect key items to unlock new paths.
•	A time limit is set to increase the challenge.

2. Level Design
•	Beginner Levels: Tutorial levels to help players get familiar with controls.
•	Intermediate Levels: More complex mazes with added traps and hidden passages.
•	Advanced Levels: Requires the use of multiple puzzle-solving techniques and offers higher difficulty.
3. Design Issue
•	Design three sections of the problem, including: mathematics, science, computer science related knowledge three sections
•	Design three different difficulty banks to better cope with the difficulty of three different levels

4. Character and Art Style
•	Main Character: A cute astronaut in a futuristic spacesuit.
•	Art Style: Sci-fi cartoon style with bright colors to enhance appeal.
5. Interaction and Reward System
•	Players can collect stars or energy blocks as score rewards.
•	Using less time and collecting more stars will give the player a higher score
6. Sound and Music
•	Uses electronic sci-fi music to create a futuristic atmosphere.
•	Add sound feedback (e.g. bonus item collection, use of help buttons to suggest yes, etc.) to enhance immersion.
